# STA-215-music-final-project
This is my final project for my social statistics course where I completed an analysis of songs that peaked at number one for multiple weeks from 1990-2023 using various statistics. I analyzed the streams of each song, the song length, its BPM, and whether or not each song was rap, pop, or hip hop.

# Instructions
To utilize the script, open the "STA215-machulsky.R" file that contains my code for the findings, and the "final.csv" file that contains my dataset

# Data
The data collected was 120 songs from 1990-2023 that peaked at number one for most weeks. Using a purposeful sample, I gathered data by analyzing the streams of the songs from popular music streaming services, such as spotify. I took note of the length of each song and converted it into seconds, as well as the tempo of the song using beats per minute (BPM). I also categorized each song into possible genres, such as rap, pop, and hip hop.

# Operalization
The concept of streams was operationalized through a quantitative variable counting the total number of times a song has been streamed on Spotify.

The concept of song length was operationalized through a quantitative variable counting by seconds the duration of the song.

The concept of BPM was operationalized through a quantitative variable that is measured by beats per minute to determine the tempo of the song.

The concept of rap was operationalized by whether or not the song's genre was rap through a binary variable, where "1" represented having rap as its genre, and "0" for the songs that did not.

The concept of pop was operationalized by whether or not the song's genre was pop through a binary variable, where "1" represented having pop as its genre, and "0" for the songs that did not.

The concept of hip hop was operationalized by whether or not the song's genre was hip hop through a binary variable, where "1" represented having hip hop as its genre, and "0" for the songs that did not.
