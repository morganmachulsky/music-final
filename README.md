# STA-215-music-final-project
This is my final project for my social statistics course where I completed an analysis of songs using various statistics. I analyzed the feeling of a song, the release that song is a part of, the age Lorde was when she released the song, the total number of streams, song length, if the song had a music video and if it was a single.
